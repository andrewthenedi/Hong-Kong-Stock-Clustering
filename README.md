# Hong Kong Stock Clustering

The design and execution of a stock clustering solution is carried out utilizing the given 
Hong Kong Stock data, which consists of six stocks (code 1, 11, 293, 857, 13 and 23). 
It should be noted that there is missing data on the dataset from stock 857 since its 
IPO (initial public offering) date is later, on 7 April 2000. To construct the solution, 
the daily closing price of the six stocks is used, as well as several additional informations, 
such as daily high/low and transaction volume.
